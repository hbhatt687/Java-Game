# Dodge Block
This is my first game written in java. The object is to dodge incoming blocks and to survive for as long as possible. You can use upgrades to help you along the way. I still need to implement an end-game.
## Getting Started
### Prerequisites
You will need a machine Windows in order to download and play the game. I have provided an exectuable jar file for you to download. 
### Installing
```
Download Dodge Block.rar file
```
```
Extract Dodge Block file to any location on your PC.
```
```
Run the exectuable jar file "Dodge Block"
```
## Built With
* JAVA
* [Paint.NET](https://www.getpaint.net) - Used to create sprite sheets for characters.
* [JarSplice](http://ninjacave.com/jarsplice) - Helped create proper executable jar file for the game.
